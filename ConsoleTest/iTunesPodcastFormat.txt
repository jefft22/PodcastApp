      <title>Why Environmentalism is Failing</title>
      <description>Environmental problems are well-known and have been for decades, but we still appear to be edging towards a global catastrophe. Why? Environmentalist Graham Saul believes that part of the problem is environmentalism itself. He believes it has a message problem - mainly because it doesn&apos;t have a single, coherent, unified message that people can grasp. Graham Saul has been on the forefront of environmental thought and activism for over 25 years. In this lecture, he parses the problem and points towards a step with potential planet-saving implications.</description>

      <title>The Accommodating Space: A Hotel Check-In</title>
      <description>A guest checks into a Las Vegas hotel suite, and makes it a fortress, staging a mass shooting on the city below. It&apos;s a horrific act that seems to subvert the very ethos of hotels - places of hospitality and calm. Yet hotels contain multitudes. They are sites of fantasy and functionality, pleasure and trouble. Their spaces are public and private, workplace and bedroom. They exist to house us temporarily, in luxury or in squalor. IDEAS producer Lisa Godfrey explores hotels, both in reality and the imagination, with hotel workers, designers, and writers -  to reveal how hotels reflect private desires and social truths.</description>

      <title>Christopher Hedges: Farewell America</title>
      <description>Christopher Hedges believes that America may well be in its last act. Addiction, income disparity and hollowed-out towns and cities are becoming the norm, he argues, while the political and financial sectors increasingly merge with each other to the exclusion of anyone else&apos;s interests or needs. His vision is dark, and sobering. Its only salvation, he concludes in this illustrated conversation with guest host Rachel Giese, is mass resistance.</description>

For Talaga, that cultural genocide has led to a forced disconnection from land and language by Indigenous peoples. The need now, she says, is for Indigenous self-determination in social, cultural and political arenas.</description>

      <description>We live in a glut of data. Individually we produce vast amounts of information about ourselves simply by living our lives: where we go, what we like, where we shop, our political views, which programs we watch. Each day we produce 2.5 quintillion bytes of data and the rate is growing. In the last two years alone we&apos;ve generated about 90% of the data that&apos;s out there. IDEAS contributor Anik See looks at this tremendous amount of data and how some people are harnessing it, not for surveillance or selling, but rather for the public good.</description>

      <title>Human Rights Under Attack: Gareth Peirce on The New Dark Age</title>
      <description>For more than 40 years, Gareth Peirce has fought to expose and overturn miscarriages of justice and free the wrongfully accused. Based in London, she was instrumental in freeing members of the Guildford Four, who were falsely convicted of carrying out the IRA bombing of a British pub. More recently, she has been representing members of the new suspect community - Muslims falsely accused of being terrorists. Peirce warns eroding human rights under the questionable guise of national security, is a profound attack on democracy.</description>

      <description>The U.S. midterms are yet another prompt for many Americans - and people around the world - to reflect on what America actually is now, politically, socially and culturally. Contributor David Zane Mairowitz is originally from New York, and has been living in Europe for over 50 years. He returned to the U.S. in the spring of 2017 to travel through six southern states, where he recorded his encounters with everyday people at restaurants, churches - and gun shows. His aim: to gain insight into an America he&apos;s now struggling to comprehend.</description>

      <title>The Long Arm of Ayn Rand: Why she still matters, Part 2</title>
      <description>The intelligentsia mocked her writings and lampooned her philosophy, which she called Objectivism. But Ayn Rand&apos;s books, especially her two major works, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, continue to sell millions of copies. There are Ayn Rand think tanks, academies, even dating sites. And her influence on politics and popular culture are stronger than ever. Contributor Sandy Bourque outlines Rand&apos;s improbable rise to fame and influence, and the surprising Canadian connection which helped secure her place in the history of ideas. This episode is part 2 of a two-part series.</description>

      <title>Conservative with Age: Why your political stripes change over time (Encore December 11, 2017)</title>
      <description>If you&apos;re not a socialist at twenty, you have no heart; and if you&apos;re not a conservative at forty, you have no brain.&quot; The saying has been around since at least the late 19th century, and it&apos;s not entirely clear who coined it. But the fact that it&apos;s still in circulation today says something about the way many of us do become more conservative as the years pass. Producer Peter Mitton explores why this tendency exists, and what it says about the way we acquire our political beliefs.</description>

      <title>Have I Got A Story For You!</title>
      <description>Narrative thinking is how we process and understand our own story. American psychologist, Dan McAdams wrote, &quot;We are all storytellers, and we are the stories we tell.&quot;  But some of us have no unfolding internal autobiography that helps us bridge our brains and minds. Some of us experience life episodically with one event simply following what came before with no sense of any overarching continuity. If narrative thinking is what makes us human, makes us conscious of ourselves, where does that leave those who who don&apos;t tell themselves this story, and their place in the world?</description>

      <description>Irish-born Oscar Wilde was Britain&apos;s most famous playwright in the late 19th century. He was also famous, or infamous, for being gay. But the people who arguably had the most important influence on him and his work were women.

      <description>Two hundred and fifty years ago, a relatively remote and economically-challenged country called Scotland became the surprising host to one of the most exciting intellectual developments in the world. Magically, the best and the brightest minds were being promoted and distributed by enterprising and adventurous publishers, in places like Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Not surprisingly, a select group of printers with rare genius rose to meet an obvious need. Beautiful books were born! Part 2 of a 3-part series.</description>

      <description>PhD student Mei Lan Fang&apos;s parents survived the Cultural Revolution and immigrated to Canada with dreams of settling in a country where human rights are protected and social mobility is possible. After years of financial struggle in Vancouver, the family verged on homelessness. Mei uses her family&apos;s own experience of migration from China to help her understand the life struggles of Vancouver&apos;s marginalized seniors in a virtually impossible housing market. Her approach is known as the &quot;life course perspective&quot;, reflecting a shift in how many social scientists view their work, and their roles.</description>

      <description>&quot;Innovation is actually built into our DNA. It&apos;s who we are. It&apos;s what makes us different&quot;. This is the provocative thesis of Neil Turok, Director of Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. Our true evolution he argues, is the result of trial and error (with more error!) played out over centuries. In this public talk and subsequent interview with Paul Kennedy, Turok expands on what he means by innovation, and how embracing the concept can open doors for the betterment of humankind.</description>

      <description>Deregulation. Infinite growth. Self-correcting markets. All are hallmarks of neoliberal thinking. But they&apos;re more than just assumptions about the economy. They undergird much of the most influential thinking about governance right now, and dominate political and economic thinking everywhere. The results, according to some, have been disastrous.

But it was the key to learning how a small secret society of key scientists in the federal government in the 1920s, thwarted an ill-conceived plan to move Plains Bison into Wood Buffalo National Park because it would have mixed incompatible species. But the &quot;Brotherhood&quot; did much more than that. Author and naturalist Briony Penn tells the story of the B, and how over the decades they quietly shaped the environmental movement and how we think about nature.</description>

      <description>Paul Kennedy has his understanding of reality turned-upside-down by Dr. Robert Lanza in this paradigm-shifting hour. Dr. Lanza provides a compelling argument for consciousness as the basis for the universe, rather than consciousness simply being its by-product.</description>

      <title>Planet You: The mysterious world of the microbiome</title>
      <description>There are trillions of them on -- and in -- our bodies. Microbes have existed on earth for more than three and a half billion years. Makes you wonder who&apos;s playing host to whom, and whether we humans are merely vessels for these tiny survivors. They influence everything from intestinal disorders to mental health conditions -- and we&apos;re only just beginning to understand their power over us.

      <title>Taming the Beast: Are violent urges part of men&apos;s nature? (Encore May 2, 2018)</title>
      <description>How does a just society reconcile the desire for peace, with the desire, most often by men, for violence? How much does nature stir boys, men, to fight? And to what extent can they control that stirring? Author Daemon Fairless takes IDEAS producer Mary Lynk on a road trip to try and unlock why some men are drawn to violence. They meet up with a science teacher, a MMA fighter, and a serial killer, who are profiled in his new book: Mad Blood Stirring: The Inner Lives of Violent Men.</description>

      <title>Panpsychism and the Nature of Consciousness</title>
      <description>What is consciousness? Why does it even exist? It has long been treated as the byproduct of biological complexity. The more complicated the brain, the more self-aware. Other thinkers have seen consciousness as totally distinct from the body -- dualism. But maybe consciousness, like space and time, mass and energy, is just a basic characteristic of the universe. Maybe it&apos;s a fundamental property of matter. Welcome to the concept of &quot;panpsychism&quot;. IDEAS producer Naheed Mustafa in conversation with philosopher Philip Goff.</description>

      <description>There&apos;s a lot more happening at a restaurant than simply ordering from a menu and getting your food. Restaurants are sites of self-expression - spaces in which status and distinction are performed and lines between class, race, and gender are reflected and reinforced. Contributing producers Michelle Macklem and Zoe Tennant explore how we&apos;ve gone from dining in to dining out, and what dining out reveals about our identities.</description>

      <description>Yuval Harari is a global intellectual. And the internationally bestselling author is worried: our brains are getting hacked. Artificial intelligence, biotechnology and ever-sophisticated algorithms are tapping into our values, habits, tastes, desires and the very thought patterns that define us - all to control how we shop, what we read, and whom we vote for. The notion of free will is defunct.  And the grand project of liberalism, with its focus on the individual, is worn out. But in this exclusive interview with Paul Kennedy, he explains why he remains cautiously optimistic about humanity&apos;s future.</description>
